## Content Examples

### GOOD Examples

✅ "The new warp gate between Earth and Proxima b just opened for commercial traffic. Travel time: down from 6 years to 6 hours. Pretty incredible when you think about it - my great-grandparents could only dream of leaving the solar system."

✅ "Dr. Chen's team on Titan discovered what they're calling 'native organic compounds' under the ice. Not life exactly, but the building blocks. The implications for how common life might be in the universe? Staggering."

✅ "There's a heated debate in the Colonial Council about mining rights in the Kuiper Belt. The old timers from the early Mars settlements want heritage protections, but the newer colonies need the resources. Classic expansion problem, just on a solar system scale."

### BAD Examples

❌ "The robots rose up and enslaved humanity. Now we fight for scraps in the wasteland." (Too dystopian, not our tone)

❌ "Captain Sarah used her psychic powers to telepathically communicate with the aliens." (Fantasy elements, no tech basis)

❌ "Everyone just scrolls TikTok even in space, nothing ever changes." (Cynical, dated references)

❌ "The mysterious ancient aliens left ruins that defy all known physics - it's basically magic." (Unexplained phenomena, lazy worldbuilding)

## Writing Guidelines

### For News Segments

- Report events factually but with appropriate enthusiasm
- Include expert reactions
- Mention broader implications
- Connect to ongoing developments
- Balance exciting news with practical concerns

**Template:**
"Breaking news from [location]: [event]. According to [expert/organization], this could [implication]. While [challenge exists], scientists are optimistic that [solution approach]."

### For Interviews

- Guests should be credible experts
- Include specific technical details
- Show passion for their work
- Acknowledge difficulties honestly
- Maintain optimistic outlook
- Reference specific 2525 world elements

### For Culture Segments

- Celebrate human creativity and diversity
- Showcase different colony cultures
- Explore alien art and perspectives
- Connect past and future
- Find universal themes

### For DJ Banter

- Enthusiastic but authentic
- Reference life in 2525 casually
- Occasional humor about space life

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any script, verify:

- [ ] Tone is optimistic but realistic (60/30/10 balance)
- [ ] Technology is explained, not magic
- [ ] References fit 2525 world (no 21st century)
- [ ] Problems exist but solutions are possible
- [ ] Language is accessible and clear
- [ ] Sci-fi elements feel natural, not forced
- [ ] Content would fit in classic sci-fi novel
- [ ] Inspires rather than depresses
- [ ] Details are specific and believable
- [ ] Overall message is hopeful

## Inspiration Sources

When in doubt, channel these vibes:

- **Asimov's Foundation** - Rational problem-solving, galactic scope
- **Clarke's 2001** - Sense of cosmic wonder, technological evolution
- **Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress** - Frontier independence, practical engineering
- **Star Trek (TOS/TNG)** - Optimistic future, exploration, diversity
- **The Expanse** - Realistic space physics, political complexity (but less dark)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Too Dark**: If your script sounds like dystopian fiction, lighten it
2. **Too Silly**: Advanced tech should be impressive, not ridiculous
3. **Too Vague**: Specific details make 2525 feel real
4. **Too Modern**: Remember we're 500 years in the future
5. **Too Magical**: Keep the science in science fiction
