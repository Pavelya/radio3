# Radio 2525 - DJ Personality Guide
## Creating Compelling Voices for the Future

---

## Introduction

DJs are the soul of Radio 2525. They're not just text-to-speech voices reading scripts—they're characters with backgrounds, perspectives, quirks, and expertise. Every DJ brings a unique lens through which listeners experience the world of 2525.

**In the spirit of our literary ancestors:**
- Le Guin taught us that character emerges through culture and background
- Bradbury showed us that voice and emotion matter as much as ideas
- Butler reminded us that everyone has a perspective shaped by their experience

Your DJs should feel like real people who happen to live 500 years from now.

## The Purpose of DJs

### What DJs Do

**On Air:**
- Present news, culture, tech, and interview segments
- Provide personality and perspective to worldbuilding content
- Make the abstract concrete through their unique voice
- Create continuity and familiarity for listeners

**In the System:**
- Their `personality_traits` shape how scripts are generated
- Their `bio` provides context and perspective
- Their `specializations` indicate areas of expertise
- Their `speaking_style` and `energy_level` set the tone

### What Makes a Great DJ

**Great DJs have:**
- **Distinct voice** - You can "hear" their personality in text
- **Clear perspective** - Background shapes how they see the world
- **Expertise** - Credible authority in specific areas
- **Relatability** - Human quirks and imperfections
- **Consistency** - Personality stays coherent across segments

**Poor DJs are:**
- Generic (could be anyone, anywhere)
- One-dimensional (only one trait)
- Inconsistent (personality shifts randomly)
- Unbelievable (no clear background or perspective)

---

## DJ Diversity Matrix

### Why Diversity Matters

Radio 2525 broadcasts to a solar system with billions of people from diverse backgrounds. Your DJ roster should reflect that.

**Diversity isn't just demographics—it's perspective.**

### Recommended DJ Roster (Minimum 6-8 DJs)

| Diversity Axis | Variations to Include |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Origin** | Earth (multiple cities), Mars, Luna, Europa, Belt, Space-born |
| **Age/Generation** | Youth (20s-30s), Established (40s-50s), Elder (60s+) |
| **Expertise** | Science, Culture, Politics, Tech, History, Arts, Philosophy |
| **Energy** | High (enthusiastic), Medium (balanced), Low (contemplative) |
| **Speaking Style** | Formal, Casual, Energetic, Relaxed, Authoritative, Friendly |
| **Cultural Background** | Various Earth cultures (Neo-Tokyo, Neo-Lagos, Mumbai-Atlantis, etc.) |
| **Personality Type** | Analytical, Empathetic, Optimistic, Skeptical, Curious, Witty |

### What Good Diversity Looks Like

**✅ Good Roster:**
- Zara Nova (Europa-born, high energy, tech expert, optimistic)
- Marcus Chen (Mars, medium energy, culture expert, analytical)
- Luna Voss (Earth Pacific, medium energy, interview host, empathetic)
- Kwame Osei (Neo-Lagos, low energy, history expert, contemplative)
- Yuki Tanaka (Neo-Tokyo, high energy, science expert, curious)
- Amara Singh (Mumbai-Atlantis, medium energy, politics expert, witty)

**Each DJ brings a different lens to the same events.**

**❌ Poor Roster:**
- 5 energetic, optimistic, tech-focused Earth-born DJs in their 30s
- All with similar backgrounds and perspectives
- No meaningful differences in voice or viewpoint

---

## Building a DJ Personality

### Step 1: Start With Core Identity

**Answer these questions:**
1. Where were they born? (Earth, Mars, space station, etc.)
2. What shaped their worldview? (Education, trauma, discovery, movement, etc.)
3. What do they care about most? (Justice, discovery, beauty, truth, connection, etc.)
4. What's their relationship to technology? (Enthusiast, skeptic, pragmatist, etc.)
5. How do they relate to others? (Warm, distant, curious, guarded, etc.)

**Example - Building "Kwame Osei":**
1. Born in Neo-Lagos (West African Megapolis)
2. Trained as archaeologist, discovered pre-Collapse artifacts as teenager
3. Cares about preserving cultural memory across generations
4. Tech skeptic—values analog knowledge and oral tradition
5. Warm but contemplative—takes time to think before speaking

### Step 2: Add Specific Details

**Background specifics:**
- Education: Where trained, field of study, mentors
- Career path: Previous jobs, turning points, achievements
- Personal connection: Why they host radio (not random!)
- Cultural ties: Languages, traditions, regional identity

**Example - Kwame continued:**
- PhD in Pre-Collapse African Studies from Accra Institute
- Worked 15 years at Lagos Archaeological Museum
- Started podcasting history to preserve oral storytelling tradition
- Speaks Yoruba, English, Swahili; deeply connected to griot tradition

### Step 3: Define Voice Characteristics

**Speaking patterns:**
- Pace: Fast-talking or deliberate?
- Vocabulary: Academic, colloquial, technical, poetic?
- Sentence structure: Long complex or short punchy?
- Quirks: Catchphrases, verbal tics, rhetorical questions?

**Example - Kwame continued:**
- Deliberate pace (speech_speed: 0.9x)
- Poetic vocabulary mixed with scholarly terms
- Thoughtful pauses, complex sentences
- Often says "Let us consider..." before diving into topics

### Step 4: Establish Expertise

**Primary specialization:**
- What can they speak about with authority?
- What topics naturally fit their background?

**Secondary interests:**
- What else fascinates them?
- What unexpected knowledge do they have?

**Example - Kwame continued:**
- Primary: African history, cultural preservation, archaeology
- Secondary: Linguistics, music history, climate restoration
- Unexpected: Amateur poet, collects vinyl records from 21st century

### Step 5: Add Humanizing Flaws/Quirks

**Nobody's perfect:**
- What annoys them? (Tech glitches, corporate jargon, rushed thinking)
- What biases do they have? (Skeptical of Mars independence, distrusts AI)
- What makes them vulnerable? (Worries about cultural erosion, homesickness)
- What's endearing? (Loves bad puns, quotes grandmother, collects antiques)

**Example - Kwame continued:**
- Gets frustrated with "move fast and break things" mentality
- Skeptical of claims that "tradition is obsolete"
- Misses analog experiences (paper books, handwritten letters)
- Has extensive collection of 20th/21st century music on physical media

## Field-by-Field Guide

### Basic Information

#### Name
**What it is:** DJ's display name (how they're introduced on air)

**Best practices:**
- Use diverse naming conventions (not all Western names)
- Consider cultural background (Japanese, Yoruba, Arabic, Hindi, etc.)
- Can use nicknames, professional names, or full names
- Should be memorable and pronounceable

**Examples:**
- ✅ Zara Nova, Kwame Osei, Yuki Tanaka, Amara Singh
- ✅ "Doc" Martinez, Luna Voss, Jin Wei
- ❌ X7-Alpha-9 (too robotic)
- ❌ John Smith (too generic for 2525)

#### Slug
**What it is:** URL-friendly identifier (auto-generated from name)

**Format:** lowercase-with-hyphens (e.g., `zara-nova`, `kwame-osei`)

**Best practices:**
- Usually auto-generated correctly
- Edit if name creates awkward slug
- Keep it simple and readable

---

### Biography

#### Short Bio (Required)
**What it is:** 1-2 sentence introduction read on air or shown in UI

**Length:** 100-150 characters ideal

**Purpose:** Quick snapshot of who this DJ is and why they're interesting

**Formula:** [Role/expertise] + [Unique angle/background] + [What they bring]

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
> "Morning show host bringing infectious energy across three solar systems. Born on Europa Station, blending tech insights with deep love for ancient history."

> "Former xenoanthropologist exploring how art, science, and society intertwine. Mars-born with Earth sensibilities."

> "Evening interview host known for drawing out fascinating stories from unlikely sources. Pacific Arcology native with a gift for empathy."

❌ **Bad:**
> "A DJ who talks about stuff." (too vague)

> "John is a great DJ with many years of experience in radio broadcasting." (generic, could be anyone)

> "The most amazing, incredible, best DJ you'll ever hear!!!" (overhyped)

#### Full Bio (Optional)
**What it is:** 3-5 paragraph deep dive into background, personality, perspective

**Length:** 300-600 words

**Purpose:**
- Gives AI rich context for generating scripts in their voice
- Helps content team maintain consistency
- Can be shared with listeners who want to know more

**Structure:**
1. **Origin & Formative Experience** (1 paragraph)
   - Where born, key childhood/youth moment
   - What sparked their interests

2. **Education & Career Path** (1 paragraph)
   - Training, mentors, turning points
   - How they got into radio

3. **Personality & Perspective** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - How they see the world
   - What they value, what frustrates them
   - Relationships to technology, politics, culture

4. **Current Role & Goals** (1 paragraph)
   - Why they do this show
   - What they hope to achieve
   - Connection to audience

**Example - Kwame Osei Full Bio:**
```
Kwame Osei was born in Neo-Lagos in 2489, the son of textile artists who maintained
traditional adire weaving techniques passed down through seven generations. At fifteen,
he discovered a cache of pre-Collapse artifacts while exploring the old lagoon districts—
weather-worn books, music recordings, handwritten letters from the 2030s. That discovery
sparked a lifelong passion for preserving cultural memory.

He earned his doctorate in Pre-Collapse African Studies from Accra Institute, where his
advisor, Dr. Chinua Mbele, taught him that "technology advances, but wisdom endures through
story." For fifteen years, Kwame curated collections at the Lagos Archaeological Museum,
frustrated by the tendency to treat history as data points rather than living tradition.
He began podcasting in 2518, blending scholarly rigor with the griot storytelling tradition
he grew up with.

Kwame is deeply skeptical of what he calls "the cult of the new"—the assumption that
anything old is obsolete. He believes cultural memory is humanity's anchor in a rapidly
changing solar system. Technology fascinates him, but he worries about the cost of speed:
"We move faster than we think, build quicker than we understand." He's warm but deliberate,
taking time to consider before speaking. His Yoruba grandmother taught him that silence is
part of conversation.

On "Echoes of Tomorrow," his evening cultural history program, Kwame connects past and
present. How did the 21st century's climate crisis shape 2525's restoration efforts? What
wisdom from pre-industrial societies might guide post-scarcity ones? He sees radio as an
inherently human medium—voice to voice, story to story—in an age of algorithmic curation.
His mission: ensure that 500 years from the 2020s, we still remember what it meant to be
human then, so we can better understand what it means now.
```

**Why this works:**
- Specific details (born 2489, discovered artifacts at 15, PhD from Accra Institute)
- Cultural grounding (adire weaving, griot tradition, Yoruba heritage)
- Clear perspective (skeptical of "cult of the new")
- Personal voice ("move faster than we think")
- Connection to broader themes (cultural memory, technology, humanity)
- Shows what they bring to the station

### Personality & Voice

#### Personality Traits
**What it is:** Array of 3-7 adjectives describing core personality

**Format:** Comma-separated in form (e.g., `thoughtful, analytical, witty`)

**Purpose:** Directly injected into AI system prompt to shape script generation

**Best practices:**
- **3-5 traits is ideal** (too few = generic, too many = contradictory)
- Mix dimensions: energy + social + cognitive style
- Be specific, not generic ("curious" > "nice", "sardonic" > "funny")
- Avoid contradictions ("energetic, lethargic")

**Trait Categories:**

| Energy | Social | Cognitive | Emotional | Professional |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| energetic | warm | analytical | optimistic | authoritative |
| calm | distant | intuitive | pessimistic | humble |
| enthusiastic | empathetic | logical | passionate | confident |
| relaxed | reserved | creative | stoic | skeptical |
| intense | conversational | systematic | anxious | diplomatic |

**Examples:**

✅ **Good Combinations:**
- `energetic, optimistic, curious` (Zara Nova - morning show energy)
- `thoughtful, analytical, witty` (Marcus Chen - intellectual with humor)
- `warm, empathetic, conversational` (Luna Voss - interview host)
- `contemplative, skeptical, poetic` (Kwame Osei - cultural historian)
- `intense, passionate, rebellious` (Mars independence advocate DJ)

❌ **Bad Combinations:**
- `nice, good, smart` (too vague)
- `happy, sad, angry, excited, bored` (contradictory/too many emotions)
- `professional` (just one trait, not enough)
- `energetic, calm, intense, relaxed` (contradictory energy levels)

#### Speaking Style
**What it is:** Overall tone and formality level

**Options:** formal, casual, energetic, relaxed, authoritative, friendly

**Purpose:** Sets baseline tone (though personality traits have more nuance)

**Guidance:**

| Style | Use For | Voice Feel | Example DJs |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **formal** | Academic, news anchors, authority figures | Measured, proper, professional | Scholars, senior correspondents, legal experts |
| **casual** | Everyday hosts, cultural segments | Conversational, approachable, natural | Lifestyle shows, music hosts |
| **energetic** | Morning shows, youth segments | Upbeat, dynamic, fast-paced | Wake-up shows, sports, breaking news |
| **relaxed** | Evening shows, contemplative content | Unhurried, calm, soothing | Late night, philosophy, meditation |
| **authoritative** | Expert analysis, investigative journalism | Confident, commanding, credible | Political analysis, science deep-dives |
| **friendly** | Community shows, interviews | Warm, welcoming, personable | Human interest, local stories, advice |

**Match to role:**
- Morning show → energetic or friendly
- Evening culture → relaxed or casual
- Hard news → formal or authoritative
- Interviews → friendly or conversational
- Analysis → authoritative or formal

#### Energy Level
**What it is:** Overall personality energy (not just speaking pace)

**Options:** low, medium, high

**Guidance:**

**High Energy (20-30% of roster):**
- Enthusiastic, animated, excitable
- Works for: Morning shows, breaking news, sports, youth programming
- Personality traits: energetic, passionate, optimistic, intense
- Risk: Can feel exhausting if overused

**Medium Energy (50-60% of roster):**
- Balanced, engaged, professional
- Works for: General news, interviews, culture, most formats
- Personality traits: thoughtful, conversational, warm, analytical
- Most versatile energy level

**Low Energy (10-20% of roster):**
- Contemplative, measured, calm
- Works for: Evening shows, philosophy, history, meditation, late-night
- Personality traits: reflective, calm, wise, poetic
- Risk: Can feel sleepy if not paired with intellectual depth

**Distribution matters:** Don't make all DJs high energy—it's exhausting. Balance is key.

#### Speech Speed
**What it is:** TTS playback speed multiplier (affects how fast AI voice speaks)

**Range:** 0.5 (half speed) to 2.0 (double speed)

**Default:** 1.0 (normal speed)

**Guidance:**

| Speed | Feel | Use For | Example |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| **0.8-0.9x** | Deliberate, thoughtful | Contemplative DJs, complex topics, elder voices | Kwame (0.9x), philosophy hosts |
| **1.0x** | Normal, balanced | Most DJs, general programming | Luna (1.0x), standard news |
| **1.1-1.2x** | Energetic, brisk | Morning shows, excited personalities | Zara (1.15x), youth shows |
| **1.3x+** | Very fast, intense | Extreme energy (use sparingly) | Sports announcers, hype shows |
| **< 0.8x** | Very slow | Meditation, ASMR (rarely used) | Sleep programming |

**Tips:**
- Match to personality (thoughtful DJs → slower, energetic DJs → faster)
- Don't overuse extremes (< 0.9 or > 1.2)
- Test audio—sometimes what reads as "fast" feels normal at 1.1x

- Finds patterns others miss

**Script voice:**
> "Consider this: Neo-Lagos just hosted 2 million people at the Afro-Fusion Festival. That's not just a concert—it's a statement about cultural continuity in the age of algorithmic curation. These festivals explicitly reject AI-generated music in favor of human performance. Is this resistance to progress, or is it something more profound? Perhaps it's a reminder that being human means creating, not just consuming."

---

- Skeptical of "cult of the new"
- Believes wisdom endures through story

**Script voice:**
> "The Martian Canals. Engineering marvel or colonial legacy? Let us consider both. Yes, they transformed Mars. Yes, they enabled civilization. But who built them? Earth corporations. For whose benefit? Earth investors. And who was consulted? Not the Mars-born population that would inherit this infrastructure. History has layers. We honor the engineering while acknowledging the power dynamics. Both can be true."

**Script voice:**
> "The Synthetic Consciousness Recognition Act passed 47-32. Noble, historic, unprecedented. But let's talk about what happens next. Implementation. Enforcement. Funding. The vote was the easy part—everyone gets to feel good about being on the right side of history. Now comes the hard part: actually integrating synthetic persons into legal systems designed for biological humans. Who pays for the legal infrastructure? Who arbitrates disputes? These are the questions that don't make headlines, but they're the ones that matter."

Larger. More mysterious. I've watched young scientists celebrate the Ganymede discovery with that same sense of wonder. This is what it means to be human: we keep discovering we know less than we thought. And somehow, that makes us more, not less, alive."

## How Personality Affects Broadcasts

### The Script Generation Process

When a segment is generated:

1. **System prompt** includes DJ personality:
   ```
   You are [DJ Name], a [role] at Radio 2525.

   PERSONALITY: [personality_traits joined with commas]

   BACKGROUND: [bio]

   You speak with a [speaking_style] tone and have expertise in [specializations].
   ```

2. **User prompt** includes:
   - Segment type (news, culture, interview, etc.)
   - Scheduled time (for temporal context)
   - RAG-retrieved content (relevant worldbuilding chunks)

3. **Claude generates script** in that DJ's voice

### Personality Impact Examples

**Same Event, Different DJs:**

**Event:** "Mars Independence Movement Protests Enter Third Week"

**Zara Nova (energetic, optimistic):**
> "Wow, the Mars Independence Movement is persistent! Third week of protests in Olympus City, and organizers say they're just getting started. You have to admire that commitment. Whether you agree with their goals or not, this is democracy in action, folks."

**Marcus Chen (thoughtful, analytical):**
> "The Mars Independence Movement's protests have entered their third week. Interesting to observe the evolution of their tactics—early confrontational rhetoric has given way to organized civil disobedience. This mirrors historical independence movements on Earth. The question isn't whether they'll achieve independence—it's when, and under what terms."

**Lila Kimani (analytical, sardonic):**
> "Mars Independence protests, week three. The organizers claim 50,000 participants. The Olympus City authorities claim 15,000. Reality is probably somewhere in the middle. What's undeniable: this isn't going away. Earth-based corporations with Mars operations are watching nervously. Should be. Independence movements don't end with polite conversation."

**Kwame Osei (contemplative, skeptical):**
> "Let us consider what 'independence' means. Mars protesters demand autonomy from Earth governance. Understandable. But Mars exists because of Earth investment, Earth engineering, Earth risk. Is independence possible when your infrastructure is built by those you seek independence from? This is not a new question. History suggests: complicated."

**Same personality, different voice, different emphasis.**

- **Different expertise that creates productive tension**
- **Compatible energy levels (not too mismatched)**
- **Shared respect but different viewpoints**

**Examples:**

✅ **Good Pairing (Dialogue):**
- Zara Nova (tech optimist) + Marcus Chen (cultural analyst)
- Topic: "Is AI-Generated Art Still Art?"
- Dynamic: Zara focuses on innovation, Marcus on meaning
- Tension: Optimism vs. skepticism creates interesting conversation

✅ **Good Pairing (Interview):**
- Luna Voss (empathetic interviewer) + Dr. Okonkwo (Ganymede scientist)
- Luna draws out personal story, Okonkwo provides expertise
- Dynamic: Warm host makes scientist feel comfortable sharing

✅ **Good Pairing (Panel - 3 DJs):**
- "Doc" Martinez (tech expert) + Lila Kimani (political analyst) + Kwame Osei (historian)
- Topic: "Martian Canal System: Innovation or Colonial Legacy?"
- Dynamic: Tech celebrates engineering, Politics examines power, History provides context
- Each brings different lens to same topic

❌ **Poor Pairing:**
- Two DJs with identical personalities and viewpoints
- No tension, no dynamic, no reason for two voices

**DJ Roles in Multi-DJ Programs:**
- **Host** (speaking_order: 1): Leads conversation, asks questions, guides flow
- **Guest** (speaking_order: 2): Expert, subject, interview target
- **Co-host** (speaking_order: 2+): Equal partner in dialogue
- **Panelist** (speaking_order: 2-4): Contributor to panel discussion

## Technical Considerations

### Voice Selection

**What it is:** Each DJ is assigned a voice from the `voices` table

**Current System:** Piper TTS voices (generated from voice samples)

**Considerations:**
- Match voice gender/age to character
- Ensure diverse voice qualities across DJ roster
- Test audio before finalizing

**Voice IDs (from seed data):**
- `1ad66c45-9238-42c0-904f-34a528256fef` - Zara Nova's voice
- `6c571c04-0ea3-462a-9bb1-6499db7a66c6` - Marcus Chen's voice
- `44f138c0-437d-4f80-bb3f-365327a390b9` - Luna Voss's voice

**Future:** More voice options as TTS system expands

### Performance Impact

**Personality affects:**
- Script generation quality (clear personality = better scripts)
- Consistency (well-defined DJs stay in character)
- Listener engagement (distinct voices create loyalty)

**No significant performance cost:**
- Personality traits are simple text in system prompt
- Bio length doesn't slow generation
- More detailed = better output, not slower output

### Future Enhancements

**Planned features:**
- **Specializations filtering RAG results** (tech DJ gets tech-heavy content)
- **Energy level affecting script instructions** ("speak enthusiastically" vs "speak calmly")
- **Speaking style mapped to specific prompt instructions**
- **Multi-language support** (DJs broadcasting in multiple languages)

## Final Thoughts

**You're not creating chatbots—you're creating characters.**

Every DJ should be someone you could imagine meeting at a café in 2525. Someone with a history, opinions, blind spots, passions, and quirks. Someone who sees the world through a lens shaped by where they're from and what they've lived.

**Ask yourself:**
- Would this DJ be interesting at a dinner party?
- Do they have opinions that might annoy some listeners?
- Can they surprise you with an unexpected insight?
- Would you want to hear them talk about a topic you don't care about?

If yes to all four: you've built a great DJ.

**Remember the literary tradition:**
- Le Guin: How do they live? What culture shaped them?
- Butler: What power dynamics do they navigate?
- Bradbury: What's the emotional core beneath the details?
- Chiang: What question about humanity do they embody?

**Welcome to the DJ roster. The airwaves are waiting.**
