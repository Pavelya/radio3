## 1. Overview

*(Write 1-2 concise paragraphs. Start with a strong, engaging sentence that defines the topic and its significance in 2525. Answer the question: **What is this, and why does it matter to people in the solar system?**)*

[Start writing your overview here. For example: "The Martian Canals are a continent-spanning network of enclosed aqueducts that represent humanity's most ambitious engineering project and the lifeblood of the Red Planet's terraformed ecosystem..."]

## 2. Historical Context / Origins

*(Write 2-4 paragraphs describing how this topic came to be. Connect it to the established timeline from the History documents. Answer the questions: **What problem did this solve? Who were the key players? What were the major turning points in its development?**)*

[Provide the backstory here. For example: "The dream of a green Mars is as old as space travel itself, but the practical effort began after the devastating Martian Water Crisis of 2510, which proved subsurface aquifers alone were insufficient..."]

## 3. Current State (2525)

*(This is the core of the document. Write 3-5 paragraphs with rich, specific details about how this topic exists **right now**. Use subheadings (`###`) if needed to break up complex ideas.)*

[Describe the topic in detail here. Consider the following prompts:]
*   **For Locations:** What does it look, sound, and smell like? Who lives/works here? What is the architecture like?
*   **For Technology:** How does it work in simple terms? Who uses it daily? What are its limitations?
*   **For Culture/Politics:** What are the core beliefs or rules? Who are the leaders or key figures? How does it manifest in daily life?

### [Optional Subheading for a Specific Feature]

[Add more detail here. For instance, for the Martian Canals, a subheading could be "### The Aqueduct Structure and Operation."]

## 4. Impact on Society & Culture

*(Write 2-3 paragraphs explaining the "so what?" of your topic. How has this changed the way people live, work, think, or interact? Include quotes from fictional characters to bring it to life.)*

[Explore the human element here. For example: "The constant presence of the Canals has shaped a unique Martian psyche. 'You're never truly lost on Mars,' says third-generation farmer Kaelen Ibrahim. 'Just follow the water.' This sentiment has seeped into Martian art, music, and even language..."]

## 5. Challenges & Conflicts

*(Write 2-3 paragraphs detailing the problems, debates, or tensions associated with this topic. Nothing is perfect. This makes the world feel real and creates story opportunities.)*

[Detail the controversies and downsides. For example: "Despite their success, the Canals are a source of constant political friction.

## 6. Connections to Other Lore

*(Write 1-2 paragraphs explicitly linking this document to other topics in the universe. This is crucial for the RAG system to build a web of knowledge.)*

[Make connections here. Reference other documents by name. For example: "The engineering principles used in the Canals were first pioneered in the floating city of **Mumbai-Atlantis** (see `LOC-008`). The ongoing political disputes over water rights are a central issue for the **Mars Independence Movement** (see `POL-003`) and are frequently debated under the legal framework of the **Outer Planets Authority** (see `POL-004`)."]
