## 1. Overview

In the gravity wells of planets, manufacturing is a fight against weight. In the void of space, it is an art form. Zero-G manufacturing is the revolutionary industrial process that allows for the construction of massive structures and the creation of perfectly formed materials in a microgravity environment. From the colossal hull of a freighter taking shape at the **Deimos Shipyards** to the flawless fiber optic cables grown in the vacuum of a Lunan factory, this technology is the key to building a true spacefaring civilization. It is a high-risk, high-reward industry that has made the grand scale of 26th-century life possible, cementing the economic power of the off-world colonies that have mastered it.

## 2. Historical Context / Origins

The concept is as old as space travel itself, but its practical application was the single greatest challenge of the **First Expansion**. The immense cost and danger of launching large, pre-fabricated components from Earth's heavy gravity made building anything of significant size in space economically impossible. The solution was to move not just the assembly, but the entire factory, into orbit.

The first large-scale "orbital forges" were established in a high Earth orbit in the 23rd century, processing raw materials ferried up from **Luna**. The true revolution, however, came with the construction of the **Deimos Shipyards**. By pairing the manufacturing facilities directly with the raw material supply chain coming from the **Asteroid Belt**, the cost of building massive interplanetary ships plummeted. This innovation broke Earth's monopoly on heavy construction and was the moment the frontier truly gained the industrial capacity to build its own future.

## 3. Current State (2525)

Zero-G manufacturing is a highly specialized and automated industry, concentrated in the low-gravity environments of moons and orbital stations.

### The Technology

*   **Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication (EBF3):** The workhorse of heavy construction. Robotic arms wielding powerful electron beams melt and fuse powdered metal or asteroid regolith in a vacuum, "3D-printing" massive, single-piece structures like ship hulls or station supports without the seams and weak points of traditional assembly.
*   **Crystal Growth & Alloy Synthesis:** In the absence of gravity, crystals can be grown to a size and purity unattainable on a planet. This is used to create flawless semiconductors for advanced computing and perfectly structured metal alloys for high-stress applications.
*   **Automated Assembly Swarms:** Fleets of coordinated **robotic drones** perform the intricate work of attaching components, running wiring, and sealing hulls on the massive structures being printed. Human oversight is conducted remotely or by small crews of highly-trained EVA specialists.

### Major Hubs

*   **Deimos Shipyards:** The undisputed king of heavy construction. Specializes in building the massive hulls of interplanetary freighters and warships.
*   **Luna:** The center for high-tech, delicate manufacturing. Its vacuum-sealed factories produce the solar system's most advanced microchips, quantum optics, and medical-grade materials.
*   **The Belt (Various Stations):** Many corporate-owned asteroids have their own specialized foundries for refining raw ore into construction-grade materials on-site.

## 4. Impact on Society & Culture

This technology has created a new industrial aristocracy: the "Fabricators." These highly-trained human engineers and EVA technicians who oversee the automated swarms are among the highest-paid and most respected blue-collar workers in the solar system. They are a close-knit community, known for their calm precision and their ability to work for long hours in the most dangerous environment known to man.

Zero-G manufacturing is a profound source of pride for off-worlders. It represents their mastery over the void and their economic independence from Earth. For a Martian, the sight of a new ship's frame glowing under the construction lights at Deimos is a powerful symbol of their collective strength.

"An Earther thinks a skyscraper is big," says Jarek, a master fabricator and third-generation Deimos worker. "They're fighting gravity every inch of the way. Here, we don't fight. We dance with physics. We can build a ship a kilometer long with a crew of twelve and a swarm of a thousand bots. We're not just building bigger. We're building smarter. We're building the future, and we're doing it out here, in the dark."

## 5. Challenges & Conflicts

The industry is dominated by a handful of **Major Mega-Corporations** who own the patents for the most advanced EBF3 printers and fabrication software. This gives them immense monopolistic power, allowing them to dictate the price and availability of new ships and stations, a major source of tension with the **OPA** and the **Mars Independence Movement**.

Industrial espionage is rampant. The digital blueprints for a new class of warship or a more efficient freighter design are some of the most valuable and heavily-guarded secrets in the corporate world.

The work is also incredibly dangerous. A software glitch in an assembly swarm can lead to catastrophic structural failures. A rupture in a molten metal conduit can create a deadly spray of shrapnel. The vast construction sites also generate fields of micro-debris that pose a significant navigational hazard for all ships in the area.

## 6. Connections to Other Lore

This technology is the beating heart of the **Deimos Shipyards** (`LOC-013`) and the high-tech factories of **Luna** (`LOC-004`). It relies on raw materials supplied from the **Asteroid Belt** (`LOC-006`) and is powered by compact **Fusion Energy** systems (`TECH-002`). The process is heavily dependent on **Robotics & Automation** (`TECH-006`). The products of this industry—the great ships—are what make **Sub-Light Travel** (`TECH-001`) possible and drive the **Solar Economy** (`ECON-001`).
