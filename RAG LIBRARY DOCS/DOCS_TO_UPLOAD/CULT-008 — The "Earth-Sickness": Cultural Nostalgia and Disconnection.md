## 1. Overview

The "Earth-Sickness," known clinically as Chronic Planetary Disassociation, is a pervasive and uniquely 26th-century psychological condition that affects millions of off-world humans. It is not a physical illness, but a profound sense of cultural and existential disconnection from a homeworld that most have never visited. It manifests as a deep, obsessive nostalgia for an idealized, historical Earth—a longing for open skies, real rain, and green landscapes that are known only through Holo-Media. This condition is a powerful cultural force, shaping the art, politics, and consumer habits of the frontier, while also creating a deep-seated psychological vulnerability that the great powers of the solar system have learned to exploit.

## 2. Historical Context / Origins

The condition was first identified in the late 24th century among second and third-generation Martian colonists. Psychologists noted a rising trend of melancholia, anxiety, and a fixation on Terran history and media among young Martians who had never left their home planet. They had no personal memory of Earth, yet they felt a deep sense of loss for it. The condition was dubbed "Earth-Sickness," a modern echo of the homesickness felt by the terrestrial explorers of old.

Its proliferation was directly fueled by the media dominance of the **Earth Federation**. As Holo-Media became more immersive, children on Mars and in the Belt were raised in sterile, engineered habitats while consuming a constant stream of entertainment depicting the lush, vibrant, "natural" world of Earth. This created a cognitive dissonance: their reality was the red dust and recycled air of a dome, but their cultural imagination was filled with the blue oceans and green forests of a planet they might never see.

## 3. Current State (2525)

In 2525, the Earth-Sickness is a recognized and widespread social phenomenon, particularly among the young and disaffected on Mars and in the Belt.

### Symptoms and Manifestations

*   **Obsessive Media Consumption:** Sufferers often spend an inordinate amount of time-consuming Terran **Holo-Media**, historical dramas, and nature documentaries, sometimes to the detriment of their real-world responsibilities.
*   **Cultural Mimicry:** They may adopt archaic Terran fashions, listen exclusively to historical music, or attempt to cultivate rare, expensive Earth-grown plants in their habitats.
*   **"Sense-Seeking":** A powerful craving for the sensory experiences of Earth. This has created a huge market for "sensory simulations"—virtual reality experiences that mimic the feeling of wind or the smell of rain—and an even larger black market for smuggled Terran goods like real soil, sea salt, or dried flowers.
*   **Political Idealism:** For some, the sickness manifests as a political belief that the problems of the frontier could be solved if their society were more like the idealized, stable world of Earth.

### Societal Response

On Mars and in the Belt, the condition is viewed with a mixture of sympathy and scorn. It is often seen as a sign of weakness, a failure to embrace one's own Martian or Belter identity. The **Mars Independence Movement** and the **OPA** actively campaign against it, promoting local culture and history as an "antidote" to the seductive allure of Earth's media empire.

## 4. Impact on Society & Culture

The Earth-Sickness has a profound impact on the interplanetary economy. The "nostalgia market" is a multi-trillion credit industry. **Major Mega-Corporations** specifically design and market products to appeal to this off-world yearning, from genetically engineered Martian fruits that mimic the taste of Terran originals to atmospheric additives that can make a habitat's air smell like a forest after a storm.

Artistically, the condition has inspired some of the frontier's most poignant works. The "Void-Folk" music genre is filled with songs of longing for a home the singer has never known. Many popular Martian holo-shows explore themes of identity and belonging, contrasting the harsh reality of frontier life with the beautiful, and often false, dream of Earth.

"They sell us our own history, but polished and clean," says a Martian poet known for her work on the subject. "They show us the beauty of the Great Restoration but not the mud and the sacrifice. They sell us a dream of Earth, and in buying it, we forget how to dream of Mars."

## 5. Challenges & Conflicts

*   **Political Exploitation:** The **Earth Federation** is often accused of weaponizing the Earth-Sickness. Its cultural programming is a form of soft power, a constant, gentle reminder that Earth is the center of the human universe. By promoting a single, idealized vision of humanity's home, they subtly undermine the legitimacy of independent off-world cultures.
*   **Generational Divide:** The condition is far more common in younger generations. Older Martians and Belters, who either remember the early, difficult days or were raised on stories of them, often have a more cynical and realistic view of Earth. This creates a painful divide, where parents see their children rejecting their own heritage in favor of a corporate-sponsored fantasy.
*   **Psychological Vulnerability:** At its most extreme, the Earth-Sickness can lead to severe depression, social withdrawal, and a complete inability to cope with the realities of off-world life.

## 6. Connections to Other Lore

The Earth-Sickness is a direct consequence of the cultural dominance of **Earth** (`LOC-002`) and its export of **Holo-Media** (`CULT-004`). It is a significant social problem on **Mars** (`LOC-003`) and in the **Asteroid Belt** (`LOC-006`), and is actively combated by the cultural wings of the **Mars Independence Movement** (`POL-003`) and the **OPA** (`POL-004`). The condition fuels a massive nostalgia market, which is a key revenue stream for the **Major Mega-Corporations** (`ECON-003`). The philosophy of **Voidism** (`CULT-002`) can be seen as a direct ideological rejection of the Earth-Sickness.
