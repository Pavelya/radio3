## 1. Overview

The Climate Crisis Era is the great, scarring trauma that ended the old world and forged the new one. Spanning over a century, this was not a single event but a long, grinding period of ecological collapse, social chaos, and desperate survival that is seared into the collective memory of humanity. It was the age of the Great Inundation, the Fire-Skies, and the Resource Wars—a dark chapter that saw the death of nations and the loss of billions of lives. Yet, out of this crucible of suffering, the modern world was born. The crisis forced the unification of humanity under the **Earth Federation**, spurred the development of the **fusion** and **geo-engineering** technologies that underpin 26th-century life, and instilled the deep-seated ecological reverence that defines modern Terran culture.

## 2. Historical Context / Origins

The era is broadly divided into three phases, a descent into chaos followed by a slow, agonizing climb back to stability.

### The Tipping Point (c. 2020 – 2040)

This was the final, chaotic end of the old world. The cascading effects of centuries of industrial pollution reached a point of no return. Feedback loops in the climate system triggered rapid, unpredictable shifts. "Hundred-year storms" became an annual occurrence, crop failures led to global food shortages, and the first major coastal cities were permanently abandoned to the rising seas. The fragmented, nationalistic governments of the 21st century proved utterly incapable of mounting a coordinated response, leading to a complete loss of public faith in existing institutions.

### The Long Calamity (c. 2040 – 2100)

This is remembered as the darkest period in human history since the Black Death. With global supply chains shattered and governments collapsing, the world descended into a desperate struggle for survival.
*   **The Great Inundation:** Sea levels rose by several meters, submerging vast coastal regions and displacing over two billion people, creating the largest refugee crisis in history.
*   **The Fire-Skies:** Runaway wildfires, fueled by drought and extreme heat, consumed entire continents, turning the skies of Earth a hazy, smoky orange for decades.
*   **The Resource Wars:** The remaining powers fought brutal, desperate wars over the last remaining sources of fresh water, arable land, and critical minerals.

### The Unification & Great Restoration (c. 2100 – 2150)

Facing the real possibility of extinction, the surviving human populations finally chose unity over conflict. Regional powers coalesced into continental blocs, which in turn formed the first provisional **Earth Federation**. Its sole mandate: to save the biosphere. This new global government, wielding unprecedented emergency powers, initiated the "Great Restoration." This was humanity's first attempt at planetary engineering: building colossal sea walls to protect cities like **Mumbai-Atlantis**, launching the first large-scale **atmospheric processors** to scrub CO2, and deploying the first generation of commercial **fusion reactors** to power the immense effort. It was a slow, brutal, and multi-generational war against the consequences of the past.

## 3. Impact on Society & Culture

The psychological scars of the Climate Crisis Era are the bedrock of modern Terran society.
*   **Gaianism:** The dominant philosophical movement on Earth, **Gaianism**, was born directly from this trauma. The reverence for the planet as a sacred, living entity is a direct reaction to having almost killed it.
*   **Ecological Anxiety:** Terran culture is defined by a collective, low-grade anxiety about ecological stability. Public displays of atmospheric carbon levels are as common as stock tickers, and any sign of environmental instability can trigger widespread panic.
*   **The Rationale for Expansion:** The trauma of the Calamity is the primary justification for the off-world colonies. The **First Expansion** was driven by the desperate, species-wide consensus that humanity could never again risk keeping all of its eggs in one basket.

## 4. Challenges & Conflicts (The Legacy)

The legacy of the Crisis is not entirely heroic.
*   **The Lost Zones:** Large parts of Earth's surface remain uninhabitable "Sacrifice Zones," areas that were written off as unsalvageable during the Restoration. They serve as grim, toxic monuments to the failures of the past.
*   **Federation's Power:** The immense authority granted to the Earth Federation during the crisis was never fully relinquished. The outer colonies argue that the Federation still governs with the mindset of a global emergency council, justifying its authoritarian tendencies as necessary for "stability."
*   **Historical Guilt:** A complex sense of historical guilt pervades Terran culture. This often manifests as a political and cultural over-correction, leading to the risk-averse, sometimes stagnant policies that frustrate the ambitious frontier worlds.

## 5. Connections to Other Lore

This era is the foundational event of the **Timeline of Humanity** (`HIST-001`). It led directly to the formation of the **Earth Federation** (`POL-002`) and spurred the **First Expansion** (`HIST-003`). The struggle for survival during this period drove the development of **Fusion Energy** (`TECH-002`) and the initial versions of **Terraforming & Climate Restoration Technologies** (`TECH-003`). The architectural adaptations of megacities like **Mumbai-Atlantis** (`LOC-008`), **Neo-Tokyo** (`LOC-007`), and the **Pacific Arcology** (`LOC-010`) were all direct responses to the environmental devastation of this period.
