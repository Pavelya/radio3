## 1. Overview

The founding of the Outer Planets Authority, or OPA, was not a polite declaration in a gilded hall, but a bloody, hard-won victory forged in the dust and vacuum of the Asteroid Belt. Born from decades of corporate exploitation and Terran neglect, the OPA rose from a scattered collection of miners' unions, striking workers, and radical political groups into the first legitimate, unified government of the frontier. Its story is the saga of the "Belt Rush," the Great Strike of 2495, and the seizure of Ceres Station—a violent, desperate, and ultimately triumphant struggle for self-determination. In 2525, the OPA is the raw, pragmatic, and fiercely independent voice of the outer planets, the undisputed government of the Belters and a constant thorn in the side of the inner worlds.

## 2. Historical Context / Origins

During the "Corporate Dominion" phase of the **First Expansion Era**, the **Asteroid Belt** was the solar system's lawless backyard. **Major Mega-Corporations** operated with total impunity, treating the vast mineral wealth as their private property. Belter miners were not citizens; they were contract laborers, subject to brutal working conditions, exploitative pay, and dangerous, poorly-maintained equipment. Any attempt to organize was crushed by corporate security forces. The **Earth Federation**, content to let the corporations bear the cost and risk of the Belt, turned a blind eye to the abuses.

This brutal environment forged a powerful, shared identity among the Belters. Secret unions began to form, using coded communications and a network of trusted haulers to organize across the vast distances. These disparate groups, a mix of labor organizers, political idealists, and hardened survivalists, were the seeds of the OPA. Their symbol—a circle broken by a V-shape, representing a body being split by a canyon—became the ubiquitous graffiti of rebellion.

## 3. The Incident: The Great Strike of 2495

The catalyst for the OPA's rise was the Pallas Incident. When a corporate-owned mining habitat on the asteroid Pallas suffered a catastrophic life-support failure due to deferred maintenance, the parent corporation, Neo-K-Metals, refused to pay for a rescue operation, writing off the 5,000 inhabitants as a financial loss. This act of inhuman calculus was the final straw.

Led by charismatic organizers like Anya Sharma and Kenzo Okoro, the scattered Belter unions united under the banner of the OPA and called for a system-wide general strike. For three months, the flow of raw materials from the Belt to Mars and Earth stopped completely. Ore processors went silent, freighters refused to leave dock, and the interplanetary economy ground to a halt.

The corporations and the Federation responded with force, sending in naval patrols and corporate marines. The conflict was short but brutal, with the OPA engaging in guerilla tactics—sabotaging mass drivers, hijacking corporate ships, and using their intimate knowledge of the Belt's terrain to their advantage. The turning point came when OPA sympathizers on **Ceres Station**, the Belt's corporate-run administrative hub, successfully seized control of the station's life support and docking bays, effectively taking the corporate leadership hostage.

## 4. Impact on Society & Culture: The Belter Nation

Beaten economically and militarily, the corporations and a humiliated Federation were forced to the negotiating table. The Ceres Accords of 2496 officially recognized the OPA as the legitimate governing body of the Asteroid Belt, granting it administrative control of Ceres Station and the right to regulate labor and trade within its territory.

It was a stunning victory. The founding of the OPA was the moment Belters stopped being a collection of disparate miners and became a self-aware political nation.
*   **A New Government:** The OPA is not a traditional democracy, but a pragmatic, representative council of the Belt's major unions and habitats. Its primary focus is on worker safety, fair trade practices, and the collective security of the Belt.
*   **Cultural Pride:** The story of the Great Strike is the central myth of Belter culture. It is told in **Void-Folk** songs and indie **Holo-Media**, a constant reminder that freedom is never given, but must be taken.

## 5. Challenges & Conflicts (The Legacy)

The OPA's victory was not absolute. It governs the people and the trade, but the Mega-Corporations still own much of the mining infrastructure and patents. This has created a tense, ongoing cold war of economic sanctions, industrial sabotage, and legal maneuvering.

The OPA is also a deeply factionalized organization. Its coalition ranges from peaceful trade unionists to radical anti-corporate terrorists. Holding this fragile alliance together is the greatest challenge for the OPA leadership.

To the **Earth Federation** and the **Mars Independence Movement**, the OPA is an unpredictable and often-unstable "third power" in the solar system. While they are sometimes allies of convenience with Mars against Earth, their ultimate loyalty is only to the Belt, making them a wild card in any interplanetary conflict.

## 6. Connections to Other Lore

The founding of the OPA is a key event in the **Timeline of Humanity** (`HIST-001`) and the history of the **Asteroid Belt** (`LOC-006`). It was a rebellion against the power of the **Major Mega-Corporations** (`ECON-003`) during the end of the **First Expansion Era** (`HIST-003`). The OPA's headquarters is **Ceres Station** (`LOC-014`). Its existence creates the three-sided political conflict that defines the **Solar System** (`LOC-001`), alongside the **Earth Federation** (`POL-002`) and the **Mars Independence Movement** (`POL-003`).
